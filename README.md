# blagger
Blagger c64 game remake.
A tribute to the 1983 Antony Crowther game, and all the hours dedicated to playing it.
This is a WIP hobby project just for fun and to learn python programming.
It's coded in Python 2.71 for Windows and uses Pygame libraries, I think it could be easily modified for Python 3.x.
I also tested on Raspbian OS with some small changes and works perfectly.
I know it does not have too much clean-code, as I said it's just a non-programmer hobby project.
the_bank.py and level_builder.py are the main files, one is the game itself and the other is to create the levels and make some custom stuff for the game.

Blagger c64 game remake
This is a WIP hobby project just for fun and to learn python programming.
It's coded in Python 2.71 for Windows and uses Pygame libraries, I think it could be easily modified for Python 3.x
I also tested on Raspbian OS with some small changes and works perfectly.
I know it does not have too much clean-code, as I said it's just a non-programmer hobby project
